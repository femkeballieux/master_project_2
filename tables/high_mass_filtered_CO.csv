Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme molecular outflows in the Milky Way in terms of mass and size. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems. <BR /> Aims: We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics, and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and to compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows in order to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. <BR /> Methods: We studied line and continuum emission at a wavelength of 3.6 mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include (J = 1−0) transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCN, HNC, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, and CCH, which trace different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high velocity resolution (~0.8 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of 3″ (~0.02 pc). <BR /> Results: Integrated intensity maps of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blueshifted and redshifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from ~80 to 20° for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> relative to the source velocity. No evidence is found for the presence of elongated, ""filament-like"" structures expected in explosive outflows. N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> emission near the western outflow lobe reveals the presence of a dense molecular structure, which appears to be interacting with the DR21 Main outflow. <BR /> Conclusions: The overall morphology as well as the detailed kinematics of the DR21 Main outflow are more consistent with a typical bipolar outflow than with an explosive counterpart. Context. The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the 158μm-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and physical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this synergy. <BR /> Aims: Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. <BR /> Methods: We present new and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15-230 GHz with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion A (M 42). We complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158μm-[CII] line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and the dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud. <BR /> Results: In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR structure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium cluster. There we find that the radio lines trace the colder portion of the ionized carbon layer, the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface.

Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme molecular outflows in the Milky Way in terms of mass and size. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems. <BR /> Aims: We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics, and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and to compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows in order to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. <BR /> Methods: We studied line and continuum emission at a wavelength of 3.6 mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include (J = 1−0) transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCN, HNC, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, and CCH, which trace different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high velocity resolution (~0.8 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of 3″ (~0.02 pc). <BR /> Results: Integrated intensity maps of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blueshifted and redshifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from ~80 to 20° for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> relative to the source velocity.

Context. The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the 158μm-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and physical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this synergy. <BR /> Aims: Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. <BR /> Methods: We present new and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15-230 GHz with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion A (M 42). We complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158μm-[CII] line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and the dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud. <BR /> Results: In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR structure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium cluster.

Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme molecular outflows in the Milky Way in terms of mass and size. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems. <BR /> Aims: We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics, and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and to compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows in order to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. <BR /> Methods: We studied line and continuum emission at a wavelength of 3.6 mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include (J = 1−0) transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCN, HNC, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, and CCH, which trace different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high velocity resolution (~0.8 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of 3″ (~0.02 pc). <BR /> Results: Integrated intensity maps of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blueshifted and redshifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from ~80 to 20° for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> relative to the source velocity. No evidence is found for the presence of elongated, ""filament-like"" structures expected in explosive outflows. N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> emission near the western outflow lobe reveals the presence of a dense molecular structure, which appears to be interacting with the DR21 Main outflow. <BR /> Conclusions: The overall morphology as well as the detailed kinematics of the DR21 Main outflow are more consistent with a typical bipolar outflow than with an explosive counterpart. Context. The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the 158μm-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and physical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this synergy. <BR /> Aims: Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. <BR /> Methods: We present new and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15-230 GHz with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion A (M 42). We complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158μm-[CII] line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and the dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud. <BR /> Results: In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR structure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium cluster. There we find that the radio lines trace the colder portion of the ionized carbon layer, the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The formation of high-mass stars remains unknown in many aspects. There are two competing families of models to explain the formation of high-mass stars. On the one hand, quasi-static models predict the existence of high-mass pre-stellar cores sustained by a high degree of turbulence. On the other hand, competitive accretion models predict that high-mass proto-stellar cores evolve from low or intermediate mass proto-stellar cores in dynamic environments. <BR /> Aims: The aim of the present work is to bring observational constraints at the scale of high-mass cores ( 0.03 pc). <BR /> Methods: We targeted with ALMA and MOPRA a sample of nine starless massive dense cores (MDCs) discovered in a recent Herschel/HOBYS study. Their mass and size ( 110 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and r = 0.1 pc, respectively) are similar to the initial conditions used in the quasi-static family of models explaining for the formation of high-mass stars. We present ALMA 1.4 mm continuum observations that resolve the Jeans length (λ<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.03 pc) and that are sensitive to the Jeans mass (M<SUB>Jeans</SUB> 0.65 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) in the nine starless MDCs, together with ALMA-<SUP>12</SUP>CO(2-1) emission line observations. We also present HCO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) molecular lines from the MOPRA telescope for eight of the nine MDCs. <BR /> Results: The nine starless MDCs have the mass reservoir to form high-mass stars according to the criteria by &lt;xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""R1""&gt;Baldeschi et al. (2017)&lt;/xref&gt;. Three of the starless MDCs are subvirialized with α<SUB>vir</SUB> 0.35, and four MDCs show sign of collapse from their molecular emission lines. ALMA observations show very little fragmentation within the MDCs. Only two of the starless MDCs host compact continuum sources, whose fluxes correspond to &lt;3 M<SUB>☉</SUB> fragments. Therefore, the mass reservoir of the MDCs has not yet been accreted onto compact objects, and most of the emission is filtered out by the interferometer. <BR /> Conclusions: These observations do not support the quasi-static models for high-mass star formation since no high-mass pre-stellar core is found in NGC 6334. The competitive accretion models, on the other hand, predict a level of fragmentation much higher than what we observe.

The results will be compared against sophisticated radiative transfer models of Core Accretion, which are already constrained by our SOFIA-FORCAST MIR to FIR observations of these same sources. In particular, we will examine to what extent simple, symmetric core models can remain valid when confronted with these new ALMA observations. Our spectral set-up also includes a suite of lines to potentially probe dense gas in core or disk and outflows. In a companion proposal, we seek to observe these same sources with same spectral set-up at resolutions of up to 0.035"", and these data would be combined with the observations proposed here to yield images that probe a very large range of scales in massive protostellar cores.

The continuum image reveals a ring-like structure with 2000 au radius, similar to morphology seen in archival 1.3 cm Very Large Array observations. Based on its spectral index and associated H30α emission, this structure mainly traces ionized gas. However, there is evidence for ~30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of dusty gas near the main millimeter continuum peak on one side of the ring, as well as in adjacent regions within 3000 au. A virial analysis on scales of ~2000 au from hot core line emission yields a dynamical mass of ~80 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. A strong velocity gradient in the H30α emission is evidence for a rotating, ionized disk wind, which drives a larger-scale molecular outflow.

Thus the SED and other properties of the system can be understood in the context of core accretion models. A structure-finding analysis on the larger-scale continuum image indicates G28.20-0.05 is forming in a relatively isolated environment, with no other concentrated sources, i.e., protostellar cores, above ~1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> found from ~0.1 to 0.4 pc around the source. This implies that a massive star can form in relative isolation, and the dearth of other protostellar companions within the ~1 pc environs is a strong constraint on massive star formation theories that predict the presence of a surrounding protocluster. ...(1)",2019,"ALMA now has the ability to see fine details around massive protostars.

This sample is part of a larger MIR/FIR survey with SOFIA. Radiative transfer models are being utilized to test geometries of dust structures, especially outflow cavities, via this IR emission. We are observing the 8 sources with ALMA in Cycle 3 from 10"" to 0.14"" scales, i.e., to ~300AU. Observations proposed here will be combined with those from Cycle 3 to give the highest spatial dynamic range possible. We also observed all 8 sources with HST in the last year. One goal is to detect jet/outflow knots at ~0.15"" resolution.

While binarity is theorized to be an essential feature of how massive stars form<SUP>6</SUP>, essentially all information about such properties is derived from observations of already formed stars, whose orbital properties may have evolved since birth. Little is known about binarity during formation stages. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of 1.3 mm continuum and H30α recombination line emission, which reveal a massive protobinary with apparent separation of 180 au at the centre of the massive star-forming region IRAS 07299-1651. From the line-of-sight velocity difference of 9.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> of the two protostars, the binary is estimated to have a minimum total mass of 18 solar masses, consistent with several other metrics, and maximum period of 570 yr, assuming a circular orbit. The H30α line from the primary protostar shows kinematics consistent with rotation along a ring of radius of 12 au. The observations indicate that disk fragmentation at several hundred astronomical units may have formed the binary, and much smaller disks are feeding the individual protostars. <P /> We report high-resolution 1.3 mm continuum and molecular line observations of the massive protostar G28.20-0.05 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The continuum image reveals a ring-like structure with 2000 au radius, similar to morphology seen in archival 1.3 cm Very Large Array observations. Based on its spectral index and associated H30α emission, this structure mainly traces ionized gas. However, there is evidence for ~30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of dusty gas near the main millimeter continuum peak on one side of the ring, as well as in adjacent regions within 3000 au. A virial analysis on scales of ~2000 au from hot core line emission yields a dynamical mass of ~80 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. A strong velocity gradient in the H30α emission is evidence for a rotating, ionized disk wind, which drives a larger-scale molecular outflow. An infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis indicates a current protostellar mass of m <SUB>*</SUB> ~ 40 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> forming from a core with initial mass M <SUB> c </SUB> ~ 300 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> in a clump with mass surface density of Σ<SUB>cl</SUB> ~ 0.8 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Thus the SED and other properties of the system can be understood in the context of core accretion models. A structure-finding analysis on the larger-scale continuum image indicates G28.20-0.05 is forming in a relatively isolated environment, with no other concentrated sources, i.e., protostellar cores, above ~1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> found from ~0.1 to 0.4 pc around the source. This implies that a massive star can form in relative isolation, and the dearth of other protostellar companions within the ~1 pc environs is a strong constraint on massive star formation theories that predict the presence of a surrounding protocluster. ...(1)",2019,"ALMA now has the ability to see fine details around massive protostars.

Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun.

Here, we report one more explosive outflow related with the massive and bright star-forming region IRAS 12326-6245 using Band 6 sensitive and high-angular-resolution (~0.″2) Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations. We find over 10 molecular and collimated well-defined streamers, with Hubble-Lemaitre-like expansion motions, and pointing right to the center of a dusty and molecular shell (reported for the first time here) localized in the northern part of the UC H II region known as G301.1A. The estimated kinematic age and energy for the explosion are ~700 yr and 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg, respectively.

In low-mass star formation, models predict disk-mediated accretion and ejection of a collimated jet accelerated by the magnetic field. The jet produces a thin outflow which clears the surrounding dense gas and produces density-enhanced cavity walls. This is well supported by observations which show a defined kinematical pattern in jet/outflow systems: a collimated jet at extremely high-velocity surrounded by low-velocity cavity walls. Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun. We propose to observe a complete sample of massive YSOs from the ATLASGAL Top100 sample to search for jet/outflow-cavity structures and establish whether massive outflows are also driven by collimated jets.

In low-mass star formation, models predict disk-mediated accretion and ejection of a collimated jet accelerated by the magnetic field. The jet produces a thin outflow which clears the surrounding dense gas and produces density-enhanced cavity walls. This is well supported by observations which show a defined kinematical pattern in jet/outflow systems: a collimated jet at extremely high-velocity surrounded by low-velocity cavity walls. Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun. We propose to observe a complete sample of massive YSOs from the ATLASGAL Top100 sample to search for jet/outflow-cavity structures and establish whether massive outflows are also driven by collimated jets.

We find over 10 molecular and collimated well-defined streamers, with Hubble-Lemaitre-like expansion motions, and pointing right to the center of a dusty and molecular shell (reported for the first time here) localized in the northern part of the UC H II region known as G301.1A. The estimated kinematic age and energy for the explosion are ~700 yr and 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg, respectively. Taking into account the recently reported explosive outflows together with IRAS 12326-6245, we estimate an event rate of once every 90 yr in our Galaxy, similar to the formation rate of massive stars.",2023,"Simulations of massive star formation show that outflows are fundamental for the formation of massive stars as they enable accretion to proceed up to stellar masses as large as 140 Msun. In low-mass star formation, models predict disk-mediated accretion and ejection of a collimated jet accelerated by the magnetic field. The jet produces a thin outflow which clears the surrounding dense gas and produces density-enhanced cavity walls. This is well supported by observations which show a defined kinematical pattern in jet/outflow systems: a collimated jet at extremely high-velocity surrounded by low-velocity cavity walls. Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun. We propose to observe a complete sample of massive YSOs from the ATLASGAL Top100 sample to search for jet/outflow-cavity structures and establish whether massive outflows are also driven by collimated jets. The sources have extremely high-velocity wings, highly indicative of jets, and luminosities L>10^5 Lsun, correponding to ZAMS stars of 20-40 Msun.

Studying such feedback is therefore crucial for understanding the formation of massive stars. We report the discovery of a photoionized bipolar outflow toward the massive protostar G45.47+0.05 using high-resolution observations at 1.3 mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and at 7 mm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). By modeling the free─free continuum, the ionized outflow is found to be a photoevaporation flow with an electron temperature of 10,000 K and an electron number density of ∼1.5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>−3</SUP> at the center, launched from a disk of radius of 110 au. H30α hydrogen recombination line emission shows strong maser amplification, with G45 being one of very few sources to show such millimeter recombination line masers. The mass of the driving source is estimated to be 30─50 M <SUB>☉</SUB> based on the derived ionizing photon rate, or 30─40 M <SUB>☉</SUB> based on the H30α kinematics. The kinematics of the photoevaporated material is dominated by rotation close to the disk plane, while accelerated to outflowing motion above the disk plane. The mass loss rate of the photoevaporation outflow is estimated to be ∼(2─3.5) × 10<SUP>−5</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. We also found hints of a possible jet embedded inside the wide-angle ionized outflow with nonthermal emissions. The possible coexistence of a jet and a massive photoevaporation outflow suggests that, in spite of the strong photoionization feedback, accretion is still ongoing. We present a detailed study of the massive star-forming region G35.2-0.74N with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm multi-configuration observations. At 0.""2 (440 au) resolution, the continuum emission reveals several dense cores along a filamentary structure, consistent with previous ALMA 0.85 mm observations. At 0.""03 (66 au) resolution, we detect 22 compact sources, most of which are associated with the filament. Four of the sources are associated with compact centimeter continuum emission, and two of these are associated with H30α recombination line emission. The H30α line kinematics shows the ordered motion of the ionized gas, consistent with disk rotation and/or outflow expansion. We construct models of photoionized regions to simultaneously fit the multiwavelength free-free fluxes and the H30α total fluxes. The derived properties suggest the presence of at least three massive young stars with nascent hypercompact H II regions. Two of these ionized regions are surrounded by a large rotating structure that feeds two individual disks, revealed by dense gas tracers, such as SO<SUB>2</SUB>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. In particular, the SO<SUB>2</SUB> emission highlights two spiral structures in one of the disks and probes the faster-rotating inner disks. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission from the general region reveals a complex outflow structure, with at least four outflows identified. The remaining 18 compact sources are expected to be associated with lower-mass protostars forming in the vicinity of the massive stars. We find potential evidence for disk disruption due to dynamic interactions in the inner region of this protocluster. The spatial distribution of the sources suggests a smooth overall radial density gradient without subclustering, but with tentative evidence of primordial mass segregation.",2019,"[Resub. of approved Cy. 4 project] ALMA now has the ability to see fine details around massive protostars. Observing continuum/lines at 1.3mm, we aim to detect substructure, especially multiplicity, disk & outflow features, in 8 massive protostellar cores at scales down to ~60 AU. This sample is part of a larger MIR/FIR survey with SOFIA. Radiative transfer models are being utilized to test geometries of dust structures, especially outflow cavities. We observed these 8 sources with ALMA in Cycle 3 from 10"" to 0.14"" scales, i.e., to ~300AU. Observations proposed here will be combined with those from Cycle 3 to give the highest spatial dynamic range possible. We also observed all 8 sources with HST in Cycle 23. One goal is to detect jet/outflow knots at ~0.15"" resolution. These may show high proper motions of ~0.14""/yr, so it is desirable for the high-res ALMA observations, which may also detect these features, to be executed as soon as possible to minimize proper motion drift.

Studying such feedback is therefore crucial for understanding the formation of massive stars. We report the discovery of a photoionized bipolar outflow toward the massive protostar G45.47+0.05 using high-resolution observations at 1.3 mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and at 7 mm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). By modeling the free─free continuum, the ionized outflow is found to be a photoevaporation flow with an electron temperature of 10,000 K and an electron number density of ∼1.5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>−3</SUP> at the center, launched from a disk of radius of 110 au. H30α hydrogen recombination line emission shows strong maser amplification, with G45 being one of very few sources to show such millimeter recombination line masers. The mass of the driving source is estimated to be 30─50 M <SUB>☉</SUB> based on the derived ionizing photon rate, or 30─40 M <SUB>☉</SUB> based on the H30α kinematics. The kinematics of the photoevaporated material is dominated by rotation close to the disk plane, while accelerated to outflowing motion above the disk plane. The mass loss rate of the photoevaporation outflow is estimated to be ∼(2─3.5) × 10<SUP>−5</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. We also found hints of a possible jet embedded inside the wide-angle ionized outflow with nonthermal emissions. The possible coexistence of a jet and a massive photoevaporation outflow suggests that, in spite of the strong photoionization feedback, accretion is still ongoing. We present a detailed study of the massive star-forming region G35.2-0.74N with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm multi-configuration observations. At 0.""2 (440 au) resolution, the continuum emission reveals several dense cores along a filamentary structure, consistent with previous ALMA 0.85 mm observations. At 0.""03 (66 au) resolution, we detect 22 compact sources, most of which are associated with the filament. Four of the sources are associated with compact centimeter continuum emission, and two of these are associated with H30α recombination line emission. The H30α line kinematics shows the ordered motion of the ionized gas, consistent with disk rotation and/or outflow expansion. We construct models of photoionized regions to simultaneously fit the multiwavelength free-free fluxes and the H30α total fluxes. The derived properties suggest the presence of at least three massive young stars with nascent hypercompact H II regions. Two of these ionized regions are surrounded by a large rotating structure that feeds two individual disks, revealed by dense gas tracers, such as SO<SUB>2</SUB>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH. In particular, the SO<SUB>2</SUB> emission highlights two spiral structures in one of the disks and probes the faster-rotating inner disks. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission from the general region reveals a complex outflow structure, with at least four outflows identified. The remaining 18 compact sources are expected to be associated with lower-mass protostars forming in the vicinity of the massive stars. We find potential evidence for disk disruption due to dynamic interactions in the inner region of this protocluster. The spatial distribution of the sources suggests a smooth overall radial density gradient without subclustering, but with tentative evidence of primordial mass segregation.",2019,"[Resub. of approved Cy. 4 project] ALMA now has the ability to see fine details around massive protostars. Observing continuum/lines at 1.3mm, we aim to detect substructure, especially multiplicity, disk & outflow features, in 8 massive protostellar cores at scales down to ~60 AU. This sample is part of a larger MIR/FIR survey with SOFIA. Radiative transfer models are being utilized to test geometries of dust structures, especially outflow cavities. We observed these 8 sources with ALMA in Cycle 3 from 10"" to 0.14"" scales, i.e., to ~300AU. Observations proposed here will be combined with those from Cycle 3 to give the highest spatial dynamic range possible. We also observed all 8 sources with HST in Cycle 23. One goal is to detect jet/outflow knots at ~0.15"" resolution. These may show high proper motions of ~0.14""/yr, so it is desirable for the high-res ALMA observations, which may also detect these features, to be executed as soon as possible to minimize proper motion drift.

In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data.

The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions.

The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages. Our setup will also allow us to study the outflow properties and to put them in relation with the observed infall rates at various evolutionary phases.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages. Our setup will also allow us to study the outflow properties and to put them in relation with the observed infall rates at various evolutionary phases.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package.

In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages. Our setup will also allow us to study the outflow properties and to put them in relation with the observed infall rates at various evolutionary phases.

J.","The formation mechanism of the most massive stars is far from completely understood. It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions.

In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages. Our setup will also allow us to study the outflow properties and to put them in relation with the observed infall rates at various evolutionary phases.

J.","The formation mechanism of the most massive stars is far from completely understood. It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions.

We have observed a sample of intermediate- to high-mass YSOs at tens of milli-arcsecond resolution in the mid-IR with the VLTI/MIDI instrument and were able to resolve the innermost warm and hot dusty structures. We wish to complement our mid-IR observations for a subsample of six best disk candidates at comparable milli-arcsecond resolution with ALMA at 1.3 mm.

The H2 luminosity (>1.2 Lsun) and spectral energy distributions of the YSOs indicate that at least one of them is massive (M > 8 Msun), but the confirmation of the outflow-driving source is limited owing to the small separation (~8"") between the YSOs and lower resolution in previous observations. The ALMA 350 GHz continuum observations with a resolution of ~0.5"" of the proposed target will reveal its inner structure, which is expected to be an elongated filament composed of multiple dense cores as observed in other high-mass YSOs (e.g., G35.20-0.74N). Molecular lines in Band 7 will also trace dense gas, outflows, and hot cores so that we can directly probe circumstellar disks and molecular outflows around massive YSOs as well as figure out the H2 outflow-driving source.

Central questions are related to the mass accumulation process from clump scales (>0.1 pc) to protostars and relative birth order of high vs. low-mass stars. Sensitive, high-resolution observations are crucial to disentangle between the various proposed scenarios. G22C1 is a globally collapsing massive clump at the center of a hub-filament system. A high-mass star-forming hot core (SMA1) has been detected with SMA observations. Multipolar outflows demonstrate the presence of substructures and compact star formation. On larger scales, filamentary inflows are feeding the globally collapsing massive clump G22C1 while SMA1 exhibits spectral infall signatures. In short, G22C1 is an ideal target for studying the mass accumulation in HMSF. We propose to map the entire G22C1 clump using ALMA/Band 7. Simultaneous observations of HCO+/H13CO+ (4-3), CO (3-2), SiO (8-7) and two 1.8 GHz windows will enable us to (a) observe the internal structure of SMA1 and companion low-mass cores around SMA1, (b) study the kinematics of embedded dense cores, and (c) determine the relative birth order of high and low-mass stars.",G22C1_a_07_7M,"Yuan, Jinghua; Wang, Ke; Wu, Yuefang; Stutz, Amelia; Ellingsen, Simon; Zavagno, Annie; Henkel, Christian; Liu, Tie;",27.84036179190309,1.4987929236668838,0.9100000262260437,uid://A001/X133d/X22ce,uid://A001/X133d/X22d3,uid://A002/Xd9668b/Xe784,Dissecting a high-mass star-forming dense clump in the center of a hub-filament system,S,TARGET,T,24.701659889277366,F,,"Outflows, jets and ionized winds, High-mass star formation",ISM and star formation,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502

We performed a dendrogram analysis of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line data to study multiscale structures and their spatio-kinematic properties, and analysed the fragmentation and dynamics of dense structures down to ~2000 au scale. Our results reveal 19 dense gas structures, out of which 12 are leaves and 7 are branches in dendrogram terminology. These structures exhibit transonic-supersonic gas motions (1$\lt \mathcal {M}\lt 5$) with overvirial states (α<SUB>vir</SUB> ≥ 2). The non-thermal velocity dispersion-size relation (σ<SUB>nt</SUB>-L) of dendrogram structures shows a weak negative correlation, while the velocity dispersion across the sky ($\delta \mathit {V_{\rm lsr}}$) correlates positively with structure size (L). Velocity structure function (S<SUB>2</SUB>(l)<SUP>1/2</SUP>) analysis of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> data reveals strong power-law dependences with lag (l) up to a scale length of ≲6000 au. The mass-size (M-R) relation of dendrogram structures shows a positive correlation with power-law index of 1.73 ± 0.23, and the leaf L17 hosting W42-MME meets the mass-size conditions for massive star formation. Blue asymmetry is observed in the H<SUP>12</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line profiles of most of the leaves, indicating infall. Overall, our results observationally support the hierarchical and chaotic collapse scenario in the proximity of the MYSO W42-MME. We present line and continuum observations (resolution ~0.″3-3.″5) made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Submillimeter Array, and Very Large Array of a young O-type protostar W42-MME (mass: 19 ± 4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>). The ALMA 1.35 mm continuum map (resolution ~1″) shows that W42-MME is embedded in one of the cores (i.e., MM1) located within a thermally supercritical filament-like feature (extent ~0.15 pc) containing three cores (mass ~1-4.4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>). Several dense/hot gas tracers are detected toward MM1, suggesting the presence of a hot molecular core with a gas temperature of ~38-220 K. The ALMA 865 μm continuum map (resolution ~0.″3) reveals at least five continuum sources/peaks (A-E) within a dusty envelope (extent ~9000 au) toward MM1, where shocks are traced in the SiO (8-7) emission. Source A associated with W42-MME is seen almost at the center of the dusty envelope and is surrounded by other continuum peaks. The ALMA CO (3-2) and SiO (8-7) line observations show the bipolar outflow extended below 10,000 au, which is driven by source A. The ALMA data hint at the episodic ejections from W42-MME. A disk-like feature (extent ~2000 au, mass ~1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) with velocity gradients is investigated in source A (dynamical mass ~9 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) using the ALMA H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> emission, and it is perpendicular to the CO outflow. A small-scale feature (below 3000 au), probably heated by UV radiation from the O-type star, is also investigated toward source A. Overall, W42-MME appears to gain mass from its disk and the dusty envelope.",2022,"In order to observationally access the existing accretion based massive star formation models, the proposal aims to probe the inner most circumstellar geometry in a rare massive young stellar object (MYSO) jet-outflow system. The target W42-MME is one of the rare newly discovered O-type protostars at its early formation stage prior to an ultracompact HII phase. With no radio counterpart, W42-MME appears driving a parsec-scale H2 outflow and a highly collimated infrared jet in the inner 4500~AU. With the proposed high resolution imaging experiment, we aim to examine in detail for the first time the morphological and kinematical structure of the molecular gas immediately associated and surrounding this rare jet-outflow system near the O-type protostar. The proposed goal can be accomplished by high resolution molecular line observations at resolution of ~0.27"" (or a thousand AU scale), which are lacking. The case study will provide further constraints to the roles of collimated jets/outflows in the massive star formation concerning the disk-mediated accretion, and will provide more insights how radiation pressure channels out in the most massive stars.",W42-MME_a_07_TM1,"Zinchenko, Igor; Zemlyanukha, Peter; Liu, Sheng-Yuan;",0.7687795375735524,0.03761382547912345,0.9156960248947144,uid://A001/X133d/X3b80,uid://A001/X133d/X3b81,uid://A002/Xdb7ab7/X1b25,Unveiling the accretion geometry in rare jet driven O-type protostar W42-MME,S,TARGET,T,4.3024819788176885,T,2022ApJ...925...41D 2023MNRAS.526.4402B,"Outflows, jets and ionized winds",ISM and star formation,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502

We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime. The metallicity dependence of massive star formation is crucial to understand because the metallicity increases with the cosmic time. Here we propose the first comprehensive survey of molecular outflows from massive protostars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The high-resolution of 0.1pc, which is the typical size of cloud cores, is required to detect molecular outflows. We use the CO (3-2) line at Band 7 as the outflow tracer to achieve the high-resolution and the high-sensitivity. In order to study both the metallicity dependence and the luminosity dependence, we select 30 massive protostars from the LMC (~1/3Zsun) and 10 massive protostars from the SMC (~1/5Zsun) at the luminosity range of 1e4-2e5 Lsun.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC.

Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>.

In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances.

The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge.

Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>.

In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge.

Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>.

In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

A uniform survey of the nearest, face-on star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), complements the Galactic knowledge. We present ALMA survey data with a spatial resolution of ~0.1 pc in the 0.87 mm continuum and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) emission toward 30 protostellar objects with luminosities of 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5.5</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in the LMC. The spatial distributions of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> (4-3) line and thermal dust emission are well correlated, indicating that the line effectively traces dense, filamentary gas with an H<SUB>2</SUB> volume density of ≳10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a line mass of ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Furthermore, we obtain an increase in the velocity line widths of filamentary clouds, which follows a power-law dependence on their H<SUB>2</SUB> column densities with an exponent of ~0.5. This trend is consistent with observations toward filamentary clouds in nearby star-forming regions within ≲1 kpc from us and suggests enhanced internal turbulence within the filaments due to surrounding gas accretion. Among the 30 sources, we find that 14 are associated with hub-filamentary structures, and these complex structures predominantly appear in protostellar luminosities exceeding ~5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The hub-filament systems tend to appear in the latest stages of their natal cloud evolution, often linked to prominent H II regions and numerous stellar clusters. Our preliminary statistics suggest that the massive filaments accompanied by hub-type complex features may be a necessary intermediate product in forming extremely luminous high-mass stellar systems capable of ultimately dispersing the parent cloud. We report the first detection of hot molecular cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a nearby dwarf galaxy with 0.2 solar metallicity. We observed two high-mass young stellar objects in the SMC with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and detected emission lines of CO, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, SO, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. Compact hot-core regions are traced by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, whose spatial extent is about 0.1 pc, and the gas temperature is higher than 100 K based on the rotation diagram analysis. In contrast, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, a classical hot-core tracer, is dominated by extended (~0.2-0.3 pc) components in both sources, and the gas temperature is estimated to be ${39}_{-6}^{+8}$ K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of SO<SUB>2</SUB> in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Galactic sources, suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO<SUB>2</SUB> formation would be regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH shows a large abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. This work, in conjunction with previous hot-core studies in the LMC and outer/inner Galaxy, suggests that the formation of a hot core would be a common phenomenon during high-mass star formation across the metallicity range of 0.2-1 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>. High-excitation SO<SUB>2</SUB> lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments of the SMC and LMC. ...(1)",2023,"Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime. The metallicity dependence of massive star formation is crucial to understand because the metallicity increases with the cosmic time. Here we propose the first comprehensive survey of molecular outflows from massive protostars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The high-resolution of 0.1pc, which is the typical size of cloud cores, is required to detect molecular outflows.

CO data from PdBI indicate that the object is rotating. Optical and infrared spectroscopy of the central object yielded a wealth of emission lines with shapes typical for accreting YSOs. Since then there is the debate whether this is the first case where the formation of a high-mass star via disk accretion is directly observed in analogy to the scenario for low-mass stars. Unfortunately there are two missing links to solve this puzzle: the kinematics and the mass of the putative disk. We propose to solve the puzzle by studying some characteristic lines and the continuum of the disk. The observations will unambiguously provide the rotation curve of the disk-like silhouette and its mass. The ALMA data will answer the long-standing questions whether the disk mass is gravitationally bound to the central object and whether it is sufficiently large to create a high-mass star.

G.; Galván-Madrid, R.; Zhang, Q.; de Wit, W. J.; Keto, E.; Johnston, K. G.; Pineda, J. E.","We present a composite model and radiative transfer simulations of the massive star-forming core W33A MM1. The model was tailored to reproduce the complex features observed with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at ≈0.2 arcsec resolution in CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN and dust emission. The MM1 core is fragmented into six compact sources coexisting within ̃1000 au. In our models, three of these compact sources are better represented as disc-envelope systems around a central (proto)star, two as envelopes with a central object, and one as a pure envelope. The model of the most prominent object (Main) contains the most massive (proto)star (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≈ 7 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) and disc + envelope (M<SUB>gas</SUB> ≈ 0.4 M<SUB>☉</SUB>), and is the most luminous (L<SUB>Main</SUB> ̃ 10<SUP>4</SUP> L<SUB>☉</SUB>). The model discs are small (a few hundred au) for all sources. The composite model shows that the elongated spiral-like feature converging to the MM1 core can be convincingly interpreted as a filamentary accretion flow that feeds the rising stellar system. The kinematics of this filament is reproduced by a parabolic trajectory with focus at the centre of mass of the region. Radial collapse and fragmentation within this filament as well as smaller filamentary flows between pairs of sources are proposed to exist. Our modelling supports an interpretation where what was once considered as a single massive star with a ̃10<SUP>3</SUP> au disc and envelope is instead a forming stellar association which appears to be virialized and to form several low-mass stars per high-mass object. We targeted the massive star-forming region W33A using the Atacama large sub/millimeter array in bands 6 (230 GHz) and 7 (345 GHz) to search for a sub-1000 au disc around the central O-type massive young stellar object W33A MM1-Main. Our data achieve a resolution of ∼0.2 arcsec (∼500 au) and resolve the central core, MM1, into multiple components and reveal complex and filamentary structures. There is strong molecular line emission covering the entire MM1 region. The kinematic signatures are inconsistent with only Keplerian rotation although we propose that the shift in the emission line centroids within ∼1000 au of MM1-Main could hint at an underlying compact disc with Keplerian rotation. We cannot however rule out the possibility of an unresolved binary or multiple system. A putative smaller disc could be fed by the large-scale spiral 'feeding filament' we detect in both gas and dust emission. We also discuss the nature of the now-resolved continuum sources.",2017,"We propose to trace the 3D velocity field of material accreting onto a massive protostar for the first time. This builds on our tantalising discovery of the signature of both rotation and infall in our previous SMA observations of methyl cyanide lines. The velocity centroid map showed a 'twist' in the rotational pattern of the emission line that is nicely explained with an infalling component in our models. We will use the higher resolution of ALMA to follow this material down to within 1000 AU of the accreting object. Our multi-transition study of different K ladders will probe gas at temperatures from 60 to 600 K in bands 6 and 7. The degree of twist is predicted to change for transitions that arise from hotter gas closer to the star. Hence, we can map out the 3D velocity field and bring a valuable new test for theories of accretion in massive star formation. These data bring a different viewpoint to those using inverse P Cygni profiles that mostly probe the radial component of infall. Our target is the proto-typical massive young stellar object W33A. It is an ideal test bed as a luminous and very embedded object with a unique array of complementary high resolution data. These include mid-IR interferometry probing the warm dust at 40 milli-arcsecond resolution and AO-fed integral field near-IR spectroscopy revealing an ionized jet and evidence for an accretion disc via the CO bandhead line profile. The near-IR reflection nebulosity also constrains the shape of the outflow cavity and the inclination. Hence, our target has sufficent high resolution, multi-wavelength data to warrant sophisticated 3D radiative transfer modelling without the degeneracies due to large numbers of unconstrained parameters that often afflict interpretation of such datasets. We have already developed 2D axi-symmetric models of the dust and gas emission. These help us both predict what ALMA will see and are ready to interpret the data we would obtain. Modelling the wealth of high spatial resolution information on the dust continuum sets up the density and temperature structure with which to model the molecular emission. With the exquisite quality expected from the ALMA data we are likely to be able to move on from using simple collapsing and rotating analytic solutions to directly testing the latest numerical simulations that treat radiative and magnetic forces. The bright (~50 K), compact (<3 arcsec) line emission from W33A means that this target is well suited to a single configuration study in cycle 1. This project will be an excellent demonstration of the 1 km long baseline capability of ALMA and provide an early science highlight.",W33A_12m_B6_repeat_x2,"Zhang, Qizhou; Galvan-Madrid, Roberto; Keto, Eric; Pineda, Jaime; Maud, Luke; de Wit, Willem-Jan; Caselli, Paola; Lumsden, Stuart;",0.48673240146557095,0.022348192543643508,0.47806987166404724,uid://A002/X7f285c/X8,uid://A002/X7f285c/X9,uid://A002/Xa43a0e/Xd8a,Tracing the 3D infall and rotation of material onto the massive protostar W33A,S,TARGET,T,2.8048970779915416,T,2017MNRAS.467L.120M 2018MNRAS.478.2505I,High-mass star formation,ISM and star formation,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502

J.","The formation mechanism of the most massive stars is far from completely understood. It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions.

J.","The formation mechanism of the most massive stars is far from completely understood. It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions.

J.","The formation mechanism of the most massive stars is far from completely understood. It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages. Our setup will also allow us to study the outflow properties and to put them in relation with the observed infall rates at various evolutionary phases.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions.

In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages. Our setup will also allow us to study the outflow properties and to put them in relation with the observed infall rates at various evolutionary phases.

J.","The formation mechanism of the most massive stars is far from completely understood. It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions.

In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages. Our setup will also allow us to study the outflow properties and to put them in relation with the observed infall rates at various evolutionary phases.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars. It has not yet been demonstrated how the high infall rates observed in massive clumps (size of ~1-2 pc) relates to the infall rates in the inner cores (~0.1 pc), and if at the sub-parsec scales they are as high as predicted in some star-formation models. In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future. The atmospheric removal method we developed can be used by any radio/millimeter/submillimeter observatory to improve the quality of its spectroscopic measurements.",2021,"One of the key problems in Galactic star-formation studies is to understand how the gas flow from the large, parsec scales down to the sub-parsec scales to form massive cores, the birth-place of future massive stars.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms. With this proposal we aim to investigate these open problems by measuring the infall rate at the core scales in a sample of clumps selected 1) to show clear evidences of large-scale infall motions in single-dish observations and 2) to be representative of different evolutionary stages.

The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump.

J.","The formation mechanism of the most massive stars is far from completely understood. It is still unclear if the formation is core-fed or clump-fed, i.e. if the process is an extension of what happens in low-mass stars, or if the process is more dynamical such as a continuous, multiscale accretion from the gas at parsec (or even larger) scales. In this context, we introduce the SQUALO project, an ALMA 1.3 and 3 mm survey designed to investigate the properties of 13 massive clumps selected at various evolutionary stages, with the common feature that they all show evidence for accretion at the clump scale. In this work, we present the results obtained from the 1.3 mm continuum data. Our observations identify 55 objects with masses in the range 0.4 ≤ M ≤ 309 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with evidence that the youngest clumps already present some degree of fragmentation. The data show that physical properties such as mass and surface density of the fragments and their parent clumps are tightly correlated. The minimum distance between fragments decreases with evolution, suggesting a dynamical scenario in which massive clumps first fragment under the influence of non-thermal motions driven by the competition between turbulence and gravity. With time gravitational collapse takes over and the fragments organize themselves into more thermally supported objects while continuing to accrete from their parent clump. Finally, one source does not fragment, suggesting that the support of other mechanisms (such as magnetic fields) is crucial only in specific star-forming regions. We present a method to mitigate the atmospheric effects (residual atmospheric lines) in single-dish radio spectroscopy caused by the elevation difference between the target and reference positions. The method is developed as a script using the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library built into the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package. We apply the method to the data taken with the Total Power Array of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The intensities of the residual atmospheric (mostly O<SUB>3</SUB>) lines are suppressed by, typically, an order of magnitude for the tested cases. The parameters for the ATM model can be optimized to minimize the residual line and, for a specific O<SUB>3</SUB> line at 231.28 GHz, a seasonal dependence of a best-fitting model parameter is demonstrated. The method will be provided as a task within the CASA package in the near future.

In addition, it is not yet defined if the infall rate changes with the evolution or it stays relatively stationary, leading to different star formation mechanisms.

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar. ALMA DDT observations are now critical to provide a clear picture of star formation in this protocluster by pinpointing the outbursting protostar with respect to the masers before they fade, and placing their kinematics into context of the dust and thermal gas structures that trace protostellar accretion and outflow.",G358.93_d_06_TM1,"Hirano, Naomi; Cyganowski, Claudia; MacLeod, Gordon; Sugiyama, Koichiro; Hunter, Todd; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Stecklum, Bringfried; Sobolev, Andrey; Burns, Ross;",0.535359862210022,0.042384947485619794,1.1349714994430542,uid://A001/X13c4/X1de,uid://A001/X13c4/X1df,uid://A002/Xdee82d/X77b6,"Exploring the dust, thermal gas, and new methanol masers in the third massive protostellar outburst: G358.931-0.030",T,TARGET,T,1.064186256168077,T,2019ApJ...881L..39B 2022AJ....163...83B,High-mass star formation,ISM and star formation,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism.

CO data from PdBI indicate that the object is rotating. Optical and infrared spectroscopy of the central object yielded a wealth of emission lines with shapes typical for accreting YSOs. Since then there is the debate whether this is the first case where the formation of a high-mass star via disk accretion is directly observed in analogy to the scenario for low-mass stars. Unfortunately there are two missing links to solve this puzzle: the kinematics and the mass of the putative disk. We propose to solve the puzzle by studying some characteristic lines and the continuum of the disk. The observations will unambiguously provide the rotation curve of the disk-like silhouette and its mass. The ALMA data will answer the long-standing questions whether the disk mass is gravitationally bound to the central object and whether it is sufficiently large to create a high-mass star.

Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme molecular outflows in the Milky Way in terms of mass and size. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems. <BR /> Aims: We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics, and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and to compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows in order to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. <BR /> Methods: We studied line and continuum emission at a wavelength of 3.6 mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include (J = 1−0) transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCN, HNC, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, and CCH, which trace different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high velocity resolution (~0.8 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of 3″ (~0.02 pc). <BR /> Results: Integrated intensity maps of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blueshifted and redshifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from ~80 to 20° for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> relative to the source velocity. No evidence is found for the presence of elongated, ""filament-like"" structures expected in explosive outflows. N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> emission near the western outflow lobe reveals the presence of a dense molecular structure, which appears to be interacting with the DR21 Main outflow. <BR /> Conclusions: The overall morphology as well as the detailed kinematics of the DR21 Main outflow are more consistent with a typical bipolar outflow than with an explosive counterpart. Context. The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the 158μm-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and physical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this synergy. <BR /> Aims: Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. <BR /> Methods: We present new and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15-230 GHz with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion A (M 42). We complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158μm-[CII] line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and the dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud. <BR /> Results: In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR structure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium cluster. There we find that the radio lines trace the colder portion of the ionized carbon layer, the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface. By modeling the emission of the 158μm-[CII] line and CRRLs as arising from a PDR we derive a thermal pressure &gt;5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a radiation field G<SUB>0</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>5</SUP> close to the Trapezium. <BR /> Conclusions: This work provides additional observational support for the use of CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line as complementary tools to study dense and diffuse PDRs, and highlights the usefulness of CRRLs as probes of the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface. ...(5)",2016,"The explosive Orion OMC1 outflow in the nearest site of active massive star formation (D~414 pc) may have been triggered by the dynamic ejection of massive stars ~500 years ago.

Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme molecular outflows in the Milky Way in terms of mass and size. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems. <BR /> Aims: We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics, and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and to compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows in order to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. <BR /> Methods: We studied line and continuum emission at a wavelength of 3.6 mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include (J = 1−0) transitions of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCN, HNC, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, and CCH, which trace different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high velocity resolution (~0.8 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of 3″ (~0.02 pc). <BR /> Results: Integrated intensity maps of the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blueshifted and redshifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from ~80 to 20° for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> relative to the source velocity. No evidence is found for the presence of elongated, ""filament-like"" structures expected in explosive outflows. N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> emission near the western outflow lobe reveals the presence of a dense molecular structure, which appears to be interacting with the DR21 Main outflow. <BR /> Conclusions: The overall morphology as well as the detailed kinematics of the DR21 Main outflow are more consistent with a typical bipolar outflow than with an explosive counterpart. Context. The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the 158μm-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and physical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this synergy. <BR /> Aims: Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. <BR /> Methods: We present new and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15-230 GHz with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion A (M 42). We complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158μm-[CII] line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and the dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud. <BR /> Results: In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR structure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium cluster. There we find that the radio lines trace the colder portion of the ionized carbon layer, the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface. By modeling the emission of the 158μm-[CII] line and CRRLs as arising from a PDR we derive a thermal pressure &gt;5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a radiation field G<SUB>0</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>5</SUP> close to the Trapezium. <BR /> Conclusions: This work provides additional observational support for the use of CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line as complementary tools to study dense and diffuse PDRs, and highlights the usefulness of CRRLs as probes of the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface. ...(5)",2016,"The explosive Orion OMC1 outflow in the nearest site of active massive star formation (D~414 pc) may have been triggered by the dynamic ejection of massive stars ~500 years ago.

The combined use of carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) and the 158μm-[CII] line is a powerful tool for the study of the energetics and physical conditions (e.g., temperature and density) of photodissociation regions (PDRs). However, there are few observational studies that exploit this synergy. <BR /> Aims: Here we explore the relation between CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line in light of new observations and models. <BR /> Methods: We present new and existing observations of CRRLs in the frequency range 0.15-230 GHz with ALMA, VLA, the GBT, Effelsberg 100m, and LOFAR towards Orion A (M 42). We complement these observations with SOFIA observations of the 158μm-[CII] line. We studied two PDRs: the foreground atomic gas, known as the Veil, and the dense PDR between the HII region and the background molecular cloud. <BR /> Results: In the Veil we are able to determine the gas temperature and electron density, which we use to measure the ionization parameter and the photoelectric heating efficiency. In the dense PDR, we are able to identify a layered PDR structure at the surface of the molecular cloud to the south of the Trapezium cluster. There we find that the radio lines trace the colder portion of the ionized carbon layer, the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface. By modeling the emission of the 158μm-[CII] line and CRRLs as arising from a PDR we derive a thermal pressure &gt;5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and a radiation field G<SUB>0</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>5</SUP> close to the Trapezium. <BR /> Conclusions: This work provides additional observational support for the use of CRRLs and the 158μm-[CII] line as complementary tools to study dense and diffuse PDRs, and highlights the usefulness of CRRLs as probes of the C<SUP>+</SUP>/C/CO interface. ...(5)",2016,"The explosive Orion OMC1 outflow in the nearest site of active massive star formation (D~414 pc) may have been triggered by the dynamic ejection of massive stars ~500 years ago.

While binarity is theorized to be an essential feature of how massive stars form<SUP>6</SUP>, essentially all information about such properties is derived from observations of already formed stars, whose orbital properties may have evolved since birth. Little is known about binarity during formation stages. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of 1.3 mm continuum and H30α recombination line emission, which reveal a massive protobinary with apparent separation of 180 au at the centre of the massive star-forming region IRAS 07299-1651. From the line-of-sight velocity difference of 9.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> of the two protostars, the binary is estimated to have a minimum total mass of 18 solar masses, consistent with several other metrics, and maximum period of 570 yr, assuming a circular orbit. The H30α line from the primary protostar shows kinematics consistent with rotation along a ring of radius of 12 au. The observations indicate that disk fragmentation at several hundred astronomical units may have formed the binary, and much smaller disks are feeding the individual protostars. <P /> We report high-resolution 1.3 mm continuum and molecular line observations of the massive protostar G28.20-0.05 with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The continuum image reveals a ring-like structure with 2000 au radius, similar to morphology seen in archival 1.3 cm Very Large Array observations. Based on its spectral index and associated H30α emission, this structure mainly traces ionized gas. However, there is evidence for ~30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of dusty gas near the main millimeter continuum peak on one side of the ring, as well as in adjacent regions within 3000 au. A virial analysis on scales of ~2000 au from hot core line emission yields a dynamical mass of ~80 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. A strong velocity gradient in the H30α emission is evidence for a rotating, ionized disk wind, which drives a larger-scale molecular outflow. An infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis indicates a current protostellar mass of m <SUB>*</SUB> ~ 40 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> forming from a core with initial mass M <SUB> c </SUB> ~ 300 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> in a clump with mass surface density of Σ<SUB>cl</SUB> ~ 0.8 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Thus the SED and other properties of the system can be understood in the context of core accretion models. A structure-finding analysis on the larger-scale continuum image indicates G28.20-0.05 is forming in a relatively isolated environment, with no other concentrated sources, i.e., protostellar cores, above ~1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> found from ~0.1 to 0.4 pc around the source. This implies that a massive star can form in relative isolation, and the dearth of other protostellar companions within the ~1 pc environs is a strong constraint on massive star formation theories that predict the presence of a surrounding protocluster. ...(1)",2019,"ALMA now has the ability to see fine details around massive protostars.

Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun.

Here, we report one more explosive outflow related with the massive and bright star-forming region IRAS 12326-6245 using Band 6 sensitive and high-angular-resolution (~0.″2) Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations. We find over 10 molecular and collimated well-defined streamers, with Hubble-Lemaitre-like expansion motions, and pointing right to the center of a dusty and molecular shell (reported for the first time here) localized in the northern part of the UC H II region known as G301.1A. The estimated kinematic age and energy for the explosion are ~700 yr and 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg, respectively.

In low-mass star formation, models predict disk-mediated accretion and ejection of a collimated jet accelerated by the magnetic field. The jet produces a thin outflow which clears the surrounding dense gas and produces density-enhanced cavity walls. This is well supported by observations which show a defined kinematical pattern in jet/outflow systems: a collimated jet at extremely high-velocity surrounded by low-velocity cavity walls. Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun. We propose to observe a complete sample of massive YSOs from the ATLASGAL Top100 sample to search for jet/outflow-cavity structures and establish whether massive outflows are also driven by collimated jets.

In low-mass star formation, models predict disk-mediated accretion and ejection of a collimated jet accelerated by the magnetic field. The jet produces a thin outflow which clears the surrounding dense gas and produces density-enhanced cavity walls. This is well supported by observations which show a defined kinematical pattern in jet/outflow systems: a collimated jet at extremely high-velocity surrounded by low-velocity cavity walls. Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun. We propose to observe a complete sample of massive YSOs from the ATLASGAL Top100 sample to search for jet/outflow-cavity structures and establish whether massive outflows are also driven by collimated jets.

We find over 10 molecular and collimated well-defined streamers, with Hubble-Lemaitre-like expansion motions, and pointing right to the center of a dusty and molecular shell (reported for the first time here) localized in the northern part of the UC H II region known as G301.1A. The estimated kinematic age and energy for the explosion are ~700 yr and 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg, respectively. Taking into account the recently reported explosive outflows together with IRAS 12326-6245, we estimate an event rate of once every 90 yr in our Galaxy, similar to the formation rate of massive stars.",2023,"Simulations of massive star formation show that outflows are fundamental for the formation of massive stars as they enable accretion to proceed up to stellar masses as large as 140 Msun. In low-mass star formation, models predict disk-mediated accretion and ejection of a collimated jet accelerated by the magnetic field. The jet produces a thin outflow which clears the surrounding dense gas and produces density-enhanced cavity walls. This is well supported by observations which show a defined kinematical pattern in jet/outflow systems: a collimated jet at extremely high-velocity surrounded by low-velocity cavity walls. Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun. We propose to observe a complete sample of massive YSOs from the ATLASGAL Top100 sample to search for jet/outflow-cavity structures and establish whether massive outflows are also driven by collimated jets. The sources have extremely high-velocity wings, highly indicative of jets, and luminosities L>10^5 Lsun, correponding to ZAMS stars of 20-40 Msun.

N.","We present (sub)millimeter imaging at 0.″5 resolution of the massive star-forming region G358.93−0.03 acquired in multiple epochs at 2 and 3 months following the recent flaring of its 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser emission. Using the Submillimeter Array and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we have discovered 14 new Class II CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH maser lines ranging in frequency from 199 to 361 GHz, which originate mostly from {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 1 torsionally excited transitions and include one {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 transition. The latter detection provides the first observational evidence that Class II maser pumping involves levels in the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 state. The masers are associated with the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a line-rich hot core. The masers present a consistent curvilinear spatial velocity pattern that wraps around MM1, suggestive of a coherent physical structure 1200 au in extent. In contrast, the thermal lines exhibit a linear pattern that crosses MM1 but at progressive position angles that appear to be a function of either increasing temperature or decreasing optical depth. The maser spectral profiles evolved significantly over one month, and the intensities dropped by factors of 3.0─7.2, with the {v}<SUB>t</SUB> = 2 line showing the largest change. A small area of maser emission from only the highest excitation lines closest to MM1 has disappeared. There are seven additional dust continuum sources in the protocluster, including another hot core (MM3). We do not find evidence for a significant change in (sub)millimeter continuum emission from any of the sources during the one month interval, and the total protocluster emission remains comparable to prior single-dish measurements. We present the most complete to date interferometric study of the centimeter-wavelength methanol masers detected in G358.93-0.03 at the burst and post-burst epochs. A unique, near-IR/(sub)millimeter-dark and far-IR-loud massive young stellar object accretion burst was recently discovered in G358.93-0.03. The event was accompanied by flares of an unprecedented number of rare methanol maser transitions. The first images of three of the newly discovered methanol masers at 6.18, 12.23, and 20.97 GHz are presented in this work. The spatial structure evolution of the methanol masers at 6.67, 12.18, and 23.12 GHz is studied at two epochs. The maser emission in all detected transitions resides in a region of ~0.″2 around the bursting source and shows a clear velocity gradient in the north-south direction, with redshifted features to the north and blueshifted features to the south. A drastic change in the spatial morphology of the masing region is found: a dense and compact ""spiral"" cluster detected at epoch I evolved into a disperse, ""round"" structure at epoch II. During the transition from the first epoch to the second, the region traced by masers expanded. The comparison of our results with the complementary Very Large Array, very long baseline interferometry, Submillimeter Array, and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array maser data is conducted. The obtained methanol maser data support the hypothesis of the presence of spiral arm structures within the accretion disk, which was suggested in previous studies of the source.",2019,"The first identification of accretion outbursts in massive protostars happened in two separate regions within the past two years, profoundly impacting the field of massive star formation. Because both events were accompanied by maser flares, single-dish maser monitoring programs were reinvigorated. As a result, a third event was discovered on 14-Jan-2019 in a poorly-studied massive star-forming region, G358.931-0.030. Since then, the global maser community has made the astounding first discoveries of numerous torsionally-excited methanol maser lines from 6-360~GHz, all likely powered by the ongoing accretion outburst. Because this outburst has been caught in a much earlier stage, we have the best opportunity yet to explore and understand the underlying mechanism. Much like NGC6334I-MM1, the lack of a near-IR counterpart indicates a very deeply-embedded protostar. ALMA DDT observations are now critical to provide a clear picture of star formation in this protocluster by pinpointing the outbursting protostar with respect to the masers before they fade, and placing their kinematics into context of the dust and thermal gas structures that trace protostellar accretion and outflow.",G358.93_d_06_TM1,"Hirano, Naomi; Cyganowski, Claudia; MacLeod, Gordon; Sugiyama, Koichiro; Hunter, Todd; Chibueze, James; Menten, Karl; Stecklum, Bringfried; Sobolev, Andrey; Burns, Ross;",0.5363434213535232,0.042384947485619794,1.1349714994430542,uid://A001/X13c4/X1de,uid://A001/X13c4/X1df,uid://A002/Xdee82d/X77b6,"Exploring the dust, thermal gas, and new methanol masers in the third massive protostellar outburst: G358.931-0.030",T,TARGET,T,1.064186256168077,T,2019ApJ...881L..39B 2022AJ....163...83B,High-mass star formation,ISM and star formation,2024-02-12T16:29:51.502

Particularly, VLA2 is an enigmatic protostar associated with a wind-driven H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser shell, which has evolved from an almost isotropic outflow to a collimated one in just 20 yr. The shell expansion seemed to be halted by an obstacle located to the northeast of VLA2. Here we present our findings from observing the 1.3 mm continuum and H<SUB>2</SUB>CO and SiO emission lines. Within a region of ~30″ (~39,000 au) diameter, we have detected 40 compact millimeter continuum sources, three of them coinciding with VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3. While the H<SUB>2</SUB>CO emission is mainly distributed in a fragmented structure around the three massive protostars, but without any of the main H<SUB>2</SUB>CO clumps spatially coinciding with them, the SiO is highly concentrated on VLA2, indicating the presence of very strong shocks generated near this protostar.

Particularly, VLA2 is an enigmatic protostar associated with a wind-driven H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser shell, which has evolved from an almost isotropic outflow to a collimated one in just 20 yr. The shell expansion seemed to be halted by an obstacle located to the northeast of VLA2. Here we present our findings from observing the 1.3 mm continuum and H<SUB>2</SUB>CO and SiO emission lines. Within a region of ~30″ (~39,000 au) diameter, we have detected 40 compact millimeter continuum sources, three of them coinciding with VLA1, VLA2, and VLA3. While the H<SUB>2</SUB>CO emission is mainly distributed in a fragmented structure around the three massive protostars, but without any of the main H<SUB>2</SUB>CO clumps spatially coinciding with them, the SiO is highly concentrated on VLA2, indicating the presence of very strong shocks generated near this protostar.
